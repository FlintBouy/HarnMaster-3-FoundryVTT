# Recommended Modules

There are a number of modules that extend the H&acirc;rnMaster system by providing new functionality or ready-made content for you to use in your campaign.  See the [Modules](https://github.com/toastygm/HarnMaster-3-FoundryVTT/wiki/Modules) page for more information.

# System Walkthrough

See the [Walkthrough](https://github.com/toastygm/HarnMaster-3-FoundryVTT/wiki/FoundryVTT-HarnMaster-Walkthrough) page for a detailed review of the system (with screenshots).

# Usage

Although most parts of this system should be self-explanatory to those familiar with H&acirc;rnMaster 3, there are some peculiarities that will be described here.

## Missing Components of H&acirc;rnMaster Rules

This system requires the user to have a copy of the H&acirc;rnMaster rules in order to play effectively. Skill descriptions and rules descriptions have been intentionally left out.  This system is not intended to be used as a character generator; for that you will need a copy of the H&acirc;rnMaster rules.

## Actors Supported

The following actors are supported:

* __Character:__ A standard humanoid character, such as a Human, Khuzdul, or Sindarin.  This can also be used for other humanoid creatures, such as Gargun.  A character has the following features:
  1. Ability Scores
  2. Public Description (characteristics others can observe about you, your behavior, and your public backstory)
  3. Basic Skills (Physical, Communication, Combat, and Craft)
  4. Esoteric Skills/Talents (Convocations, Rituals, and Psionics)
  5. Combat (Weapons, Injuries, Armor Locations)
  6. Inventory (Armor/Clothing, Misc. Gear)
  7. Biography (your personal/real characteristics, story, motivations, and attributes)

* __Creature:__ Any being not a "character" (e.g., animals, Ivashu, etc.).  A creature has the following features:
  1. Ability Scores (except no Comeliness or Morality)
  2. Basic Skills
  3. Combat (Weapons, Injuries, Armor Locations)
  4. Misc. Gear
  5. Description

* __Container:__ A token (such as a chest, a wagon, or a shop) that can contain items and can be placed separately on the canvas.

Note that when creating a character, you will be prompted whether to install standard skills and standard humanoid armor locations.  When creating a creature, no armor locations will be preloaded, since each creature will have different armor locations (although a few basic combat skills are preloaded).

## Supported Capabilities

The following capabilities are supported in both characters and creatures:

* Automatic Dice Rolls (click on the dice icon next to the item). Holding SHIFT, ALT, or CTRL keys while clicking the icon will use defaults and bypass the dialog (except for damage rolls which always require the dialog).  All of these are available as macros as well.
  * Skill check rolls
  * Spell success rolls (character only)
  * Ritual Invocation success rolls (character only)
  * Psionic Talent success rolls (character only)
  * Shock roll
  * Fumble roll
  * Stumble roll
  * General Damage roll (Non-weapon-specific)
  * Weapon Damage roll (weapon-specific)
  * Weapon Attack roll
  * Weapon Defense roll
  * Injury roll (calculates location and Injury Level)

* Automatic Calculations
  * Automatic Skill Base calculation based on Formula
  * Total Injury Levels
  * Total Gear Weight
  * Encumbrance (characters only)
  * Universal Penalty (UP)
  * Physical Penalty (PP)
  * All skill EMLs (based on ML minus UP or PP)
  * Endurance (based on Condition skill if present, otherwise calculated from abilities)
  * Move rate (characters only)
  * Spell EML and Ritual Invocation EML (accounting for spell level or invocation circle)
  * Weapon Attack ML (AML) and Defense ML (DML)

## Special Considerations

There are a few things to keep in mind as you are filling out your characters.

### Description and Biography

The Description represents readily-apparent information about your character; this information is available to anyone who observes or interacts with your character. Any information you would share with others (even if untrue) can be placed in this area, and anyone with even limited access to your character sheet can observe it.

Your Biography represents your personal characteristics and backstory; those things that are not apparent to others unless you choose to share it. This may contain personal motivations as well as personal characteristics. Your biography will only be available to those will full access to your character, not to those with only limited access.

### Diety and Piety

The assumption is that a character may have one or more religions, and a piety associated with each one.  If a character is initiated into a religion, they are assumed to have a base ML in the religion (presumably opening at SBx1) representing basic understanding of the rituals and requirements of the religion.

Piety is therefore assocated with the religion/diety, and is indicated as part of the ritual skill for that diety.  If you choose to not require characters to have any Ritual skill to get piety, you may simply leave the SB/ML at 0.

### Weapon Associated Skill

A skill in a type of weapon is distinct from the weapon itself.  For example, you might have skill in Dagger, but you actually have a Knife weapon.  For a Knife, you use the Dagger skill.  In the details for each weapon, you will see an input for the Associated Skill.  This should default to the same name as the weapon, but in many cases you will need to change this to refer to the actual skill used (for example, a Staff might use the "Spear" Associated Skill; or, alternatively, you may have a specific Staff skill that should be used instead).

Only combat skills may be chosen as an "Associated Skill" for a weapon.

### Armor Locations Probability Weight (Prob. Weight)

Hit locations play a big part in the H&acirc;rnMaster combat system.  In order to correctly calculate hit location, each armor location is designated with a Probability Weight.  You can think of this as the percentage chance of that location getting hit.  In that case, the total of all armor location probability weights must add up to 100.

There are separate probability weights for High, Mid, and Low aiming points.  For humanoid characters, if you chose to have the armor locations pre-loaded, these will already be setup to default values.  For creatures, no armor locations are available so you will need to enter your own armor locations and the probability weights for those.

# Building

If you wish to fork this code and build your own version, that is completely fine.  You will ultimately need to package the system into two files: a ZIP and a MANIFEST.  The following BASH script is an example of how to do this:

```
#!/bin/bash

VERSION=$(jq --raw-output .version $HOME/dev/github/HarnMaster-3-FoundryVTT/system.json)
BUILDDIR=$(mktemp -d -t hmk-$VERSION-XXXXXX)
RELEASEDIR=$HOME/Games/fvtt/releases/hm3/$VERSION
HM3FILE=hm3-$VERSION
echo "Begin packaging HarnMaster 3 $VERSION"
# If any prior version of the release exists, remove it
rm -rf $RELEASEDIR

# Create the release directory
mkdir -p $RELEASEDIR

# Copy all releaseable parts of the system
rsync -avz -f "- _source" -f "- scss" -f "- package.json" -f "- package-lock.json" -f "- lib" -f "- packs" -f "- .git" -f "- nogit" -f "- .DS_Store" -f "- .gitignore" -f "- .vscode/*" -f "- *.code-workspace" HarnMaster-3-FoundryVTT/* $BUILDDIR

# Build the packs from source files
for i in $(jq -r '.packs[] | [.name, .type] | @csv' HarnMaster-3-FoundryVTT/system.json | sed 's/"//g'); do
    SPEC=(${i//,/ })
    PACK=${SPEC[0]}
    TYPE=${SPEC[1]}
    mkdir -p $BUILDDIR/packs/$PACK
    fvtt package pack -n $PACK -v --type System --id hm3 -t $TYPE --in $HOME/github/HarnMaster-3-FoundryVTT/packs/$PACK/_source --out $BUILDDIR/packs/
done

# Create release zip file in release directory
(cd $BUILDDIR; zip -r $RELEASEDIR/$HM3FILE.zip * -x "*/.DS_Store")

# Copy release manifest to release directory
cp $BUILDDIR/system.json $RELEASEDIR/$HM3FILE.json

ln $RELEASEDIR/$HM3FILE.zip $RELEASEDIR/system.zip
ln $RELEASEDIR/$HM3FILE.json $RELEASEDIR/system.json

echo "Finished packaging HarnMaster 3 $VERSION"
```

This script depends on the `foundryvtt-cli` package in order to run; see https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt-cli.  This package, in turn, requires Node.js to be installed.

You can then unzip the ZIP file into your `$FOUNDRY_DATA_DIR/systems/hm3` directory (create that directory if it doesn't exist).
