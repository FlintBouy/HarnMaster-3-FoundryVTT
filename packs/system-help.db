For further information on how these assisted rolls are used, please see the section @JournalEntry[Combat - Assisted].</p>\n<h2>Associated Skill</h2>\n<p>All melee and missile weapons have a field named \"Associated Skill\". This field indicates which skill is used when using that weapon.&nbsp; This is used to determine AML/DML.&nbsp; If there is a weapon specialization that applies, that would be the best choice; if not, the base skill would apply.</p>\n<p>For missile weapons where there is no particular skill, you can choose the \"Throwing\" skill.</p>\n<h2>Thrown Items</h2>\n<p>You may want to consider creating a generic \"Thrown Item\" missile weapon that represents any otherwise unspecified thrown item (possibly with a large quantity figure, such as 999).&nbsp; This will allow you to arbitrarily throw things such as oil flasks, chairs, etc.</p>\n<h2>Single and Two-Handed Weapons</h2>\n<p>In order to model melee weapons which can be either used single- or two-handed, it is recommended to create two separate weapons: one for the weapon when used single-handed, and the other for the weapon when used two-handed.&nbsp; The entry for the one-handed weapon may be given an attack adjustment based on the \"hand mode\" of the weapon.</p>\n<h2>Melee vs. Missile Weapons</h2>\n<p>Most weapons used to launch missiles can also be used in a melee context.&nbsp; For instance, a bow can be used in melee as a type of staff for both attack and defense.&nbsp; A spear can be either used in melee combat, or thrown as a missile.&nbsp; In the case of items that can serve either purpose, the suggestion is to have two separate entries: one for the item as a melee weapon (e.g., \"Spear (melee)\") and one for the item as a missile (e.g., \"Spear (missile)\").&nbsp; If this is the case, you may set the weight of the melee version of the item to 0, since the weight is being tracked in the missile entry for the weapon.</p>\n<p>In the case of a bow or other device used to throw a missile, the weight of the bow is separate from the weight of the arrows, so they would be tracked separately.&nbsp; The bow should be tracked as a melee weapon, while the arrows are tracked as a missle weapon.</p>\n<h2>Unavailable Weapon Aspects</h2>\n<p>Certain weapons do not have some weapon aspects.&nbsp; For example, a Round Shield has a blunt aspect, but does not have edged or piercing aspects.&nbsp; When this is the case, you should indicate this by placing a -1 in the entry for the aspect that is unavailable for that weapon on the melee weapon gear detail sheet (use the edit icon to open the detail sheet).</p>\n<h2>Unarmed Combat \"Melee Weapons\"</h2>\n<p>Since all weapons that show up on the combat page must have an entry in the gear tab, there are melee weapons specifically created for hand, foot, and head.&nbsp; These melee weapons can be placed in the gear tab and equipped in order to provide the ability to perform unarmed combat.</p>\n<p>The same technique can be used with creatures in order to indicate claws and other sorts of melee attacks. These would be specified as melee weapon \"gear\", but with a weight of 0 and very likely always equipped.</p>\n<h2>Melee Weapons</h2>\n<p>This section contains&nbsp;<strong>equipped</strong> weapons that can be used in close, or melee, combat. This section only lists weapons used in combat; for information on how to add new weapons, see @JournalEntry[Sheet - Gear Tab].</p>\n<h3>Weapon Name and Icon</h3>\n<p>This field contains an icon representing the weapon and its name.&nbsp; If the name of the weapon is clicked, Automated Combat will be initiated with that weapon.&nbsp; See @JournalEntry[Combat - Automated].</p>\n<h3>Weapon Aspects</h3>\n<p>The weapon aspects blunt (B), edged (E), and piercing (P) indicate the base impact when an attack succeeds. The appropriate aspect may be cliced to begin rolling damage for that aspect using Assisted Combat.</p>\n<h3>Attack ML (AML)</h3>\n<p>In order to attack with a weapon, you may click on the AML value to begin Assisted Combat with that weapon.</p>\n<h3>Defense ML (DML)</h3>\n<p>In order to block with a weapon, you may click on the DML value to begin Assisted Combat to block with that weapon.</p>\n<h2>Missile Weapons</h2>\n<p>This section is used to track&nbsp;<strong>equipped</strong>&nbsp;missile weapons, which are weapons used to attack a target at a distance. This section only details the actual missile (e.g., an arrow), not the device used to throw the missile if any (e.g., a bow).</p>\n<p>Various fields in this section are clickable and will perform various assisted rolls as described below.</p>\n<p>Note that because missile ranges differ, some missiles that may seem similar will have separate entries. For instance, \"Arrow (Longbow)\" and \"Arrow (Shortbow)\" would be two separate entries, since the range for these two missiles is radically different. In practice it is unlikely you will have both a longbow and shortbow, so distinguishing between these two is not normally an issue.</p>\n<h3>Weapon Name and Icon</h3>\n<p>This field contains an icon representing the missile and its name.&nbsp; If the name of the missile is clicked, Automated Combat will be initiated with that weapon.&nbsp; See @JournalEntry[Combat - Automated].</p>\n<h3>Quantity</h3>\n<p>Missile quantity is an important component of missile weapons: there is generally not an infinite quantity of missiles available to the attacker. The number of available missiles is tracked here (and can be modified in the Gear section, see @JournalEntry[Sheet - Gear Tab].</p>\n<p>Note that once the missile quantity reaches 0, the missile may no longer be used until the quantity is increased above zero.&nbsp; Quantity will be reduced by one every time an attack is made with a missile weapon (regardless of whether it is successful or not).</p>\n<h3>Skill</h3>\n<p>Each missile weapon is associated with a particular skill, which is indicated here.&nbsp; For instance, an Arrow might be associated with a Bow skill.</p>\n<h3>Range</h3>\n<p>Missiles have different ranges, but all missile weapons fall into four missile range categories: short, medium, long, and extreme. This section describes these ranges, using the form&nbsp;<strong><em>range</em>/<em>impact</em></strong>.&nbsp; Range is the maximum distance in feet to be considered at that range, and impact is the base impact of the missile at that range.</p>\n<p>Missile weapons generally use only a single aspect, for example piercing, so no aspect is described.</p>\n<p>Clicking on the range will begin a Damage Roll using Assisted Combat at that range.</p>\n<h3>Attack ML (AML)</h3>\n<p>In order to attack with a missile, you may click on the AML value to begin Assisted Combat with that missile.</p>\n<h2>Injuries</h2>\n<p>This section tracks the characters injuries.&nbsp; Injuries can be either an actual contusion, cut, piercing, burn, etc., but it can also include bloodloss, shock, infection, and other ailments.&nbsp; This section tracks all of that.</p>\n<p>For each injury, the injury level and healing rate are tracked.&nbsp; Note that each injury is treated separately; if you have two injuries to the head, it will show up as two separate entries.</p>\n<p>The healing rate for each injury is clickable.&nbsp; If clicked, it will perform a \"Healing Roll\" for that injury; If successful, the IL of the injury may be reduced.</p>\n<p>Note that the injuries here will affect the Universal Penalty.</p>\n<h2>Armor Locations</h2>\n<p>Armor locations are specifically identified body parts of a character or creature that can be targeted and injured. Each of these body parts will have an armor protection rating and a likelihood of having that body part hit during combat.</p>\n<p>Standard Body Parts</p>\n<p>Because of the large number of variable settings associated with armor locations, a set of \"standard\" types has been created; use of these standard types will ease the burden of setting up these body locations.&nbsp; The standard types are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Skull</li>\n<li>Face</li>\n<li>Neck</li>\n<li>Shoulder</li>\n<li>Upper Arm</li>\n<li>Elbow</li>\n<li>Forearm</li>\n<li>Hand</li>\n<li>Thorax</li>\n<li>Abdomen</li>\n<li>Groin</li>\n<li>Hip</li>\n<li>Thigh</li>\n<li>Knee</li>\n<li>Calf</li>\n<li>Foot</li>\n<li>Wing</li>\n<li>Tentacle</li>\n<li>Tail</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When selecting one of those values, all of the other selections will be ignored and the settings taken from the standards for the given type.&nbsp; If you wish to specify your own settings, select \"Custom\".</p>\n<h3>Automatic Armor Values</h3>\n<p>Because of the way that layering of armor in HarnMaster works, determining the armor protection values for a large set of locations can become a daunting task, especially when the player takes off and puts on various parts of armor. In order to assist with this, whenever armor is equipped (worn), it automatically calculates the protection values for those areas it covers.</p>\n<p><strong>IMPORTANT</strong>: If you have setup a custom protection value for a location, and you equip armor that covers that location, your custom values will be wiped out in favor of the values from the armor.&nbsp; Either you may have armor equpped, in which case it will wipe out any custom values, or you may use your custom values instead. They can't be mixed.</p>\n<h3>Probability Weighting</h3>\n<p>One purpose of the Armor Locations section is to provide a list of locations that may be hit during combat. The system uses a technique called Probability Weighting to determine the likelihood of hitting a given area.&nbsp; In essence, instead of making each body part equally likely to be hit, you can specify the weighted likelihood that a given area will be hit.</p>\n<p>An easy way of thinking of this is to say that you are going to have 100 points, and will parcel them out across all body parts.&nbsp; If you say the Left Arm gets 5 points, then you are essentially saying there is a 5% chance of that body part getting hit.</p>\n<p>The same exact probabliity would happen if you chose to use 1000 points total, and gave 50 to the Left Arm.&nbsp; That would still be 5% probability.</p>\n<p>You may decide how many points overall and how many to give to each body part.&nbsp; There is no need to specify up front the total number of points; when the time comes to determine what part gets chosen, the system will add up all of the parts and then determine which gets hit according to its weight.</p>\n<p>Note that there are three weightings you will need to provide: for High Aim, Low Aim, and Mid Aim.</p>\n<p>It is highly recommended you look at some examples before attempting to set these on your own.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","img":"systems/hm3/images/icons/svg/book.svg","_id":"0HFubXxOFYP7e8xX"}

Some effects could be turned on for a while but then disabled until the next time they are invoked.</p>\n<p>Typical uses for Effects are magic items: artifacts that absorb a certain number of fatigue points, or that improve an actor's attack rolls, defense rolls, or that affect the impact of weapons. Other ways effects can be used include handling steeds (half encumbrance and fatigue when mounted), environmental effects (-20 to all missile attacks due to fog), etc.</p>\n<p>Effects are particularly useful when setup to expire at some future point.&nbsp; For instance, an artifact may reduce fatigue by half while worn (indefinite duration), or a character in combat may become berserk for 5 rounds (+20 to AML for all melee attacks), or a potion might deaden pain of injuries (reducing total injury level by half) for 2 hours.&nbsp; You can specify these durations, either in game time or in terms of combat rounds/turns.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, <em>all Effects are associated with actors</em>.&nbsp; The entity that is affected by the Effect is the actor.&nbsp; But the Effect may be attached either directly to an actor, or it may be attached to an item (which is then associated with an actor).

This system has been designed to enhace the experience of playing H&acirc;rnMaster by brining support for the game to the Foundry VTT platform. A wide aray of features are included, some of which are detailed in @JournalEntry[Features].</p>\n<p>It is highly recommended that you read the documentation for Foundry VTT and/or watch the various YouTube videos on using the system; I will not describe the capabilites or use of Foundry VTT here, except insofar as this system specifically uses those capabilites.</p>\n<p>This system is not designed to play the game for you or replace the rules. A specific design criteria was to automate, but provide plenty of opportunity for the GM and players to take over at any point and perform manual rolls or role-play the various aspects of the game.&nbsp; Feel free to use the automation when useful, and to abandon it when special conditions warrant. Just because something is automated does not mean it has to be used if situations in the game or GM/Player desires warrant.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1.5em;\">Actors and Items</span></p>\n<p>Foundry VTT supports two major features in gameplay: Actors and Items.&nbsp; In this system Actors represent characters, creatures, and external containers.&nbsp; A major feature of actors are they can be placed on the playing canvas and you can move them around and even enter into combat with them (although entering combat with a container is largely pointless). Items represent either physical gear (such as a sword, piece of armor, or money) or actor features (such as traits, skills, magic spells, etc.).</p>\n<h3>Actors</h3>\n<p>The three actors that are defined are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Characters: </strong>These represent human or humanoid beings that can have social structures, can perform spells and religious rituals, and act effectively like humans do.&nbsp; Some non-human opponents (even Ivashu) might be modeled as characters, including Gargun, Nolah, etc.&nbsp; See @JournalEntry[Characters] for more information.</li>\n<li><strong>Creatures: </strong>These represent non-human-like beings such as horses, some Ivashu (e.g., Vlasta), and other such beings. These creatures differ from the human-like creatures in that they generally do not have the same humanoid hit-locations, don't use magic spells (although they might use Psionics), etc. See @JournalEntry[Creatures] for more information.</li>\n<li><strong>Containers: </strong>These model real-world objects that can contain items: some obvious containers would be chests or large sacks, but less obvious would be a store (which is a sort of container of items) or vehicles (such as a wagon or cart). Note that although a horse carries items as well, it would be better modeled as a creature. A container differs from other actors because it has no abilities, skills, or any other characteristics other than the ability to contain items. Note that these differ from on-person containers because they have existence separate from other characters or creatures. See @JournalEntry[Containers] for more information.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Items</h3>\n<p>Items represent physical objects or features within the game.&nbsp; All items, with the exception of Injuries and Armor Locations, may have Effects associated with them.&nbsp; See @JournalEntry[Effects] for more information.</p>\n<p>The following items are defined:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Skills: </strong>Physical and mental activities and capabilities of characters and creatures. They are subdivided into six types: Physical, Communication, Combat, Craft, Magic, and Ritual. See @JournalEntry[Sheet - Skills Tab].</li>\n<li><strong>Traits: </strong>Physical and psyche aspects of a character or creature, such as albinism or phobias. See @JournalEntry[Sheet - Profile Tab].</li>\n<li><strong>Magic Spells: </strong>Spells and incantations performed by Shek-Pvar, associated with the various magic convocations. These should never be confused with religious invocations. See @JournalEntry[Sheet - Esoterics Tab].</li>\n<li><strong>Ritual Invocations: </strong>Religious rituals invoking divine powers performed by priests, shamen,&nbsp; and other religious persons. These should never be confused with spells. See @JournalEntry[Sheet - Esoterics Tab].</li>\n<li><strong>Psionic Talents: </strong>Mental powers and capabilties (such as telepathy or telekinesis). See @JournalEntry[Sheet - Esoterics Tab].</li>\n<li><strong>Injuries: </strong>Physical damage to the body, including blunt trauma, cuts, piercing, blood loss, infection, poisioning, and other such ailments. See @JournalEntry[Sheet - Combat Tab].</li>\n<li><strong>Armor Locations: </strong>Various locations of the body that are subject to damage in combat, such as skull, neck, arms, legs, hands, feet, wings, tails, etc. See @JournalEntry[Sheet - Combat Tab].</li>\n<li><strong>Melee Weapons (weapongear): </strong>Weapons used in close combat, such as swords, spears, shields, clubs, daggers, etc. Note that some weapons that throw missiles are considered melee weapons, such as bows (which can be treated as a sort of staff in melee combat), spears, hand axes, or knives (which can be used in melee as well as thrown).&nbsp; Weapons that can be both melee weapons and missile weapons will have separate entries for each. See @JournalEntry[Sheet - Combat Tab].</li>\n<li><strong>Missile Weapons (missilegear): </strong>Weapons that separate from the actor and strike opponents at a distance, including arrows, stones, sling bullets, javelins, throwing knives, etc. See @JournalEntry[Sheet - Combat Tab].</li>\n<li><strong>Armor: </strong>Protection for various parts of the body (i.e., armor locations) against injury. See @JournalEntry[Sheet - Gear Tab].</li>\n<li><strong>Containers: </strong>These are personal containers (different from actor containers) that are used to carry object on a person, such as bags, backpacks, belt pouches, etc.&nbsp; Waterskins and pots, although they are a sort of container, would generally not be considered containers unless they are meant to contain objects (such as coins, etc.). See @JournalEntry[Sheet - Gear Tab].</li>\n<li><strong>Misc. Gear:</strong> All other physical objects not modeled elsewhere, such as coins, tinderboxes, pans, rope, food, etc. See @JournalEntry[Sheet - Gear Tab].</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Recommended Modules</h2>\n<p>Although many modules can be used with Foundry VTT to enhance play, the following modules are specifically recommended because they interact well with features of this system.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a title=\"Dice So Nice Module\" href=\"https://foundryvtt.com/packages/dice-so-nice/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Dice So Nice</a> for enhanced ambiance when dice rolls occur.</li>\n<li><a title=\"Turn Marker Module\" href=\"https://foundryvtt.com/packages/turnmarker/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Turn Marker</a> for improved combat management, making the attacker much more apparent.</li>\n<li><a title=\"Mount Up Module for Foundry VTT\" href=\"https://github.com/Brunhine/MountUp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mount Up</a> for use with steeds.

A player can mark a token as a target either by pressing the bullseye button in the Token HUD, or double-right clicking on a token. GMs cannot use the double-right click option and instead must use the bullseye button or a module such as <a href=\"https://foundryvtt.com/packages/t-is-for-target/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">T is for Target</a>.</p>\n<h2>Initiating Automated Combat</h2>\n<p>Automated combat can be initiated in one of two ways. Either by double-clicking on the token to open its Sheet and clicking on the weapon name you would like to attack with or by pressing a previously setup macro on the Hotbar for that weapon.&nbsp; See @JournalEntry[Combat - Overview] for a discussion of setting up macros for combat.</p>\n<h2>The Flow of Automated Combat</h2>\n<p>After a player initiates automated combat, the <strong>attacker</strong> is presented with a dialog to select weapon aspect, aim (low, mid, high), and to add additional modifiers.</p>\n<p>Next, in the chat tab of the sidebar, the <strong>defender</strong> is presented with options to defend: dodge, counterstrike, block or ignore. In the case of Counterstrike or block, the defender then has to choose a weapon gear (weapon or shield) to perform the defense with.</p>\n<p>Once the defense is chosen, dice are rolled and the results compared. If the attack results in an injury, then the <strong>defender</strong> is presented with an injury button, and presses the injury button to roll it.</p>\n<p>If either the defender or attacker stumbles or fumbles, they are presented with buttons to roll the appropriate skill check.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","img":"systems/hm3/images/icons/svg/book.svg","_id":"GBqpdEyL0dZo9m06"}

{"name":"Combat - Overview","permission":{"default":0,"kpJv1acyf3Ez8dBj":3},"flags":{},"content":"<p>Combat in HarnMaster is a complex dance performed between the attacker and defender.&nbsp; Each combat round, attackers and defenders perform multiple activities and respond to various events.&nbsp; Within a single combat turn, there are decisions to be made on what weapons to use, what sort of attack to make, what aspect of weapon to use, what sort of defense to perform, multiple dice rolls for attacks, defense, table lookups to determine results of combat, and then more rolls to determine damage, lookup damage location, determine armor and damage absorption, and finaly determine injury and effects (including shock, fumbling, and stumbling).</p>\n<p>All of these decisions and activities can make all but the most trivial combat encounters very slow.&nbsp; This system was designed to specifically address this issue and increase the speed and ease of combat encounters.</p>\n<p>Because of the different needs players and GMs have, there are two complimentary mechnaisms available for combat: assisted combat and automated combat.</p>\n<h2>Assisted Combat</h2>\n<p>Assisted combat can be used anytime, whether in or out of formal combat.&nbsp; The system is designed for flexibility; users can easily insert their own activities or special rules at any point.&nbsp; There is very limited automation, slightly more than automated dice rolling, with the exception of Injury rolls which are comprehensive.&nbsp; In particular, assisted combat does not include the combat tables, which still must be consulted in order to determine outcome of combat.</p>\n<p>Because assisted combat has no requirement for the combat tracker, attacks may be initiated by anyone at any time.&nbsp; There is no relationship between the various rolls; the users are expected to know when to perform a particular roll in assisted combat. There is no concept of a \"target\"; players must track their targets themselves, and track what actions need to be taken and where they are in a combat situation, and determine appropriate next steps.</p>\n<p>For more information on assisted combat, see @JournalEntry[Combat - Assisted].</p>\n<h2>Automated Combat</h2>\n<p>Automated combat may only be used in a formal combat situation, with the combat tracker active.&nbsp; Only the combatant whose turn it is may perform attacks.&nbsp; Automated combat requires that the attacker designate a single target (by marking the token as \"targetted\").&nbsp; Exactly one target token must be designated, no more or less.&nbsp; Automated combat is then initiated, and from there it guides the characters (both attacker and defender) through a series of automated steps, prompting for decisions along the way on how to respond.&nbsp; All dice rolls and combat table lookups are handled, and the players and GM are presented with the results of combat quickly.&nbsp; By leading the players and GM through the combat situation, combat encounters become relatively quick and ... \"painless\".</p>\n<p>But a drawback to automated combat is that it is relatively inflexible. It assumes the combat situation is following the \"normal\" rules, and no unusual activities are occuring outside of the standard combat flow.&nbsp; For this reason, it may not be appropriate for all situations.&nbsp; In that case, you can always fall back on Assisted Combat.</p>\n<p>For more information on automated combat, see @JournalEntry[Combat - Automated].</p>\n<h2>Creating a Hotbar Macro</h2>\n<p>For either assisted or automated combat, use of the macro bar is very highly suggested. The macro bar will allow you to initiate combat with the press of a single hotkey button, rather than needing to open up the character sheet and select the weapon.</p>\n<p>Setting up a macro for combat is simple.&nbsp; Simply open the character sheet and drag the desired weapon to an open location on the hotbar.&nbsp; A dialog will appear asking you what sort of macro you would like to create: automated attack, or assisted attack, defense, or damage.&nbsp; Once you select one, a new macro will be created in that hotbar location for that weapon.&nbsp; You may continue to do this with other spots on the hotbar, assigning them other macros.</p>\n<p>For a list of all of the macro functions available, see @JournalEntry[Macros].</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","img":"systems/hm3/images/icons/svg/book.svg","_id":"wpxPTGayzW3jfChK"}
